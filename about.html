        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Somewhere in life, we sometimes fail and we sometimes get hurt but there’s always someone behind who would aspire us to out shine ourselves in doing enormous things. They are the reason why we stand up again and learn to mend our wounds. They are our inspiration in life, our motivator and our strength to reach success. It has always been a part of our life’s voyage to encounter different challenges in life. In every achievement, frustrations and happiness in my life, my parents are always there at my side to guide and prop me up. I am so overwhelm and grateful for I have them as my parents. They are my inspiration in doing magnificent things of my life. Seeing them suffering while working too hard under the heat of the sun just to give us a good future inspires me. Because of their efforts and warmth love, I am so inspired to study hard and more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life. Having a debt of gratitude to them, I want to pay all their hard works by giving them a sufficient and marvelous life someday. I am studying hard not only for my self but also for my family . Without them i am nothing. Let us not think that having an inspiration is an interference towards achieving something. Instead, let us think that it is a way on how we are aggravated to reach our goals in life. Let's be inspired by the people around us who truly loves and supports us all the ways we take in life.</p>
